As time passed, I realized that I have to do more in support of myself and my family. Starting my job at Raley's I was grateful to be able to learn about the retail industry, and help serve others in times of need. Following March 2020s events to the present day, I had a lot of time to reflect on myself and my passions. Amidst this time, I was able to rekindle my love for designing by designing and coding web applications. I started to learn how to code when I was 16 with my first language being JavaScript.Throughout my learning process, I overcame many hurdles. Learning data structures, variables, data types, syntax and more proved very difficult. Balancing school, my own coding education, and my job, I've had to overcome many obstacles. Even so, with the help of various free classes, websites, and the few mentors that I've reached out to in the Web Development space, I've been able to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Git/Github. I am also in the process of learning Express, MongoDB, and NodeJS. I am certain that Web Development is my calling to serve others with clean, good-looking, and efficient web applications.
